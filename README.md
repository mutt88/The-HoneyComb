# The HoneyComb
## Welcome to The HoneyComb Add-On Software!
The HoneyComb is a free and open source add-on grid software application for “Go BB Design” program. Available as a native application for Android and Windows operating systems, The HoneyComb is a C++ add-on application that is presented through a GUI which will also run through game engine and on most common processor architectures. The Creation of Go BB Design started in 2018 by a group of like minded programmers. “Go BB Design's” The HoneComb is a project run by The CherryWood personnel and developed by volunteers located around the world. It is designed to be a simple grid system that requires the user or visual hardware to take in measurements creating a grid, adjusting the grid by filling in the grid(s) space with material measurements inputted into the system to create the parameters of whatever space is available in grid(s) needing to be filled. Simply put, any adjustments added to the empty grid space, adjusts the parameters of the “fill space” given by the user's original inputs.

While HoneyComb is an add-on, it functions very well as a standard grid application for your computer, it should be designed to be the perfect companion for upcoming AR &VR platform technology. Depending on the application it can be utilized to enhance a user's AR or VR experience.

The HoneyComb can be used as a grid utilizing three (3) inch increments that may or may not require the final touches from a CAD program if utilized the design format or transitioned to units in a game platform. The geometry of the grid is dictated by the measurements or the dimensions of the filler being used.
